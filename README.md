This program stores and update a counter.  The fucntion update_counter takes a file name and reset indication (boolean True or Flase) as inputs.  If the file does not exist, it will be created and the counter will be initialized to 1.  If the file exists and the reset is set to True, the counter will be reset to 1.  If the file exist and the reset is False, the counter will increment by 1.

When the code is called in terminal, it runs its doctests and shows the results.  If you wish to run this code, add a line at the end that calls update_counter with your desired file and reset.
